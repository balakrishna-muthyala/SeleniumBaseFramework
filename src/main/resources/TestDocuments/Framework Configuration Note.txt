Create all Framework related classes&methods in "FrameworkPackage" under src/main/java 
Create all application classes&methods in Application package ( 1 class file for 1 page in package) under src/main/java 
Create all test classes&methods in testpackages ( 1 package for 1 test scenario/suite) under src/test/java 

Each class has to extends "TestBase" mandatory

test methods priority is not required, when we include the method names in testNg xml/ running from xml (If we give priority, it will consider only priority irrespective of testng xml flow")
Need to give priorities for test methods in testPackage, when we give only class name in xml
Need to give priorities for test methods in testPackage, when we want to execute from test java class

TestNG xml File name = xml Suite name = Project name-Jenkins Job Name
TestNG Test name = Test data test case name
TestNG Class name = testPackage java class name

TestResources/PropertiesFile for Project Global variables
TestResources/TestData.xlsx for Test cases test data
TestResources/WebDriverFiles for webdriver exe files

<build> tag is important in pom.xml to execute the "suiteXmlFile" from Jenkins
(ex. <suiteXmlFile>src/test/resources/VerifyCmLogin.xml</suiteXmlFile> Or <suiteXmlFile>${suiteXmlFile}</suiteXmlFile> )
